# python-games
These are a few dinky, super-simple games written to get familiar with Python.

- `dungeon-game` is a randomly-generated textual mini-maze.

- `goofy-rpg` is a textual fantasy combat game, in which you battle beasties.

- `guess-the-number` is pretty self-explanatory.

- `rock-paper-lizard` is an implementation of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

These all require Python 3.4.
